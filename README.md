## C Server Framework

### What?

This is a framework for C to enable easily creating servers in a style reminiscent of ExpressJS for Node and JavaScript.

### Why?

I enjoy using C and wanted to try using C as a server backend, but found that dealing with sockets manually is extremely tedious.
This framework aims to alleviate some of the problems I faced and allow for a more modular way to create servers.

-   Note: this framework is <b><i>not</b></i> production-ready. It's a hobby project with many missing features, vulnerabilities, etc.
